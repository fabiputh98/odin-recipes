        <h2>Real Facts: The Chaliapin Steak is an original Japanese steak.</h2>
        <p>Chaliapin Steak Don is a dish made by Sōma Yukihira for his first Shokugeki against Ikumi Mito.</p>
        <p>The dish is exclusively made by Sōma combined with the Japanese original dish, the Chaliapin Steak and the donburi concept for his first Shokugeki. Although the dish was made with cheap ingredients that can be found in a supermarket, the dish focused on both innovation and balance of the ingredients to fulfill the donburi mantra, "Dons are completed in one bowl."</p>
